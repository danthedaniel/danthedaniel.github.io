                Well, you're here. I don't really advertise this domain name.
                Maybe you're another Daniel Angell. If you happen to be the one who
                owns <a href="https://danielangell.com">danielangell.com</a>, then
                I envy you, as I don't normally go by Dan. Mayhaps you were looking
                to register this domain for yourself. In that case, I'm sorry.
                There don't seem to be any good .com domains left for our people.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you saw my email address and were curious what web content is
                hosted at this domain, I'm sorry to disappoint you. This is it!
