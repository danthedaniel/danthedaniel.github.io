The intention is to force myself to get a small taste of a bunch of new programming languages and programming paradigms. Since I was late to the party I rushed through the first 4 problems in languages I'm familiar with. But for day 5 I solved the daily problem with MIPS assembly. I look forward to learning and writing Common Lisp, Haskell, Prolog, and many more languages.

One hope I have is to complete a problem in GLSL. I'm already somewhat familiar with GLSL, but given its intended purpose it should be a true feat if it works.

You can see my Advent of Code solutions on my GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/danthedaniel/Advent-of-Code-2017).
