After more than 12 years, BaconBits, the unofficial Reddit torrent tracker,
has shut down for good. It's terrible to see such a solid community disappear.

On many torrent trackers users are able to request specific content to be
uploaded. As of BaconBits' final hours, the request fill ratio stood at 89.28%. A
dedicated community member would provide almost anything you could ask for.
For a site that never had more than 6000 users, that's quite a feat.

BaconBits pressed against its user cap of 6000 active accounts for years.
But after a computer error 4 years ago, dubbed the "Robot Uprising", the
servers pruned a large portion of tracked torrents. The community and site
never recovered.

Here's an excerpt from the original Robot Uprising announcement post:

> Our semi-airgapped database came up with the wrong system time. As in, with a date and time a few years behind... while the appservers were running on the correct time. That means a bunch of torrents were being marked as last having been seeded "a few years ago", while the appservers knew it was 2017.
> 
> That's all fine and dandy except for the fact that we automatically prune torrents that haven't been seeded for "2 weeks". From now. The situation unfortunately went unnoticed for a while (12+h).
> 
> tl;dr we've lost about half our uploads.

RIP bB. That'll do.
